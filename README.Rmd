# Installation
To install the release version (recommended) from CRAN, in R, enter
```{r Install detrendr, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("detrendr")
```
To install the development version, in R, first install `devtools` via `install.packages("devtools")`. Then enter
```{r Install detrendr dev, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rorynolan/detrendr")
```

# Use 

First let's load the library: 
```{r load}
library(detrendr)
```

## An image in need of detrending
The package contains a sample image series which can be found at  
`system.file("extdata", "bleached.tif", package = "detrendr")`. It's 500 frames of diffusing fluorescent particles which are bleaching over the course of the acquisition. We can see they're bleaching by displaying every 99th frame.

```{r visualize bleaching, fig.height=3.3, fig.width=11}
library(magrittr)
path <- system.file("extdata", "bleached.tif", package = "detrendr")
img <- ijtiff::read_tif(path, msg = FALSE)
every100th <- purrr::map(seq(1, dim(img)[4], by = 99), ~ img[, , 1, .]) %>% 
  purrr::reduce(~ cbind(.x, max(img), .y))
ijtiff::display(every100th)
```

## Detrending
We see that the intensity is much lower for the last frame, this is because the image series has been bleached. We can correct for this. 

```{r detrend, fig.height=3.3, fig.width=11}
system.time(corrected_exp <- img_detrend_exp(img, "auto", purpose = "FFS",
                                             seed = 0, parallel = 2))["elapsed"]
every100th <- purrr::map(seq(1, dim(img)[4], by = 99), 
                         ~ corrected_exp[, , 1, .]) %>% 
  purrr::reduce(~ cbind(.x, max(img), .y))
ijtiff::display(every100th)
```

So we see that the corrected series does not have this drop-off in intensity.
