## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 4 notes

Note 1. This is a new release.
Note 2. GNU make is a system requirement. This is needed to use RcppParallel.
Notes 3 and 4. Examples are taking a while (4 mins) to run. I like these examples and I would prefer not to shorten them, but I can if needed.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
